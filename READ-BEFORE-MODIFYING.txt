Xcode requires toolchains to be codesigned. Therefore if you make any changes the signature will have to be regenerated. To do that, you first have to delete the existing signature; simply delete it in Finder or `rm -r _CodeSignature`. Then execute `security find-identity -v -p codesigning` (thanks, person on StackOverflow) followed by `codesign -s [your_identity] gcc.xctoolchain` to re-sign the toolchain file. Finally, restart Xcode (Xcode will continue to use the toolchain if the signature was valid at launch time, while likewise it will refuse to use it if the signature was invalid at launch time).
